The focus of the project was to build an Interactive Dashboard for BCG Gamma’s CO2 AI product. The dashboard was built using Dash which uses the Plotly library at the backend. The dashboard provided real-time updated and generated real-time results for Calculating Net Zero Pathways to achieve Net Zero Emissions (NZE). The stack used in this project is Python, Pandas, Dash, Plotly, AWS S3, and AWS EC2. I was responsible for gathering requirements, obtaining domain knowledge, data mapping, and assisting engineers in building dashboards from Figma Designs.
