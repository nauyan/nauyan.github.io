*Yotascale’s anomaly detection model recently helped save $600,000 for Zoom—the video communications giant and one of their main clients—by alerting them immediately about a sudden cost spike due to an extra resource.* <br/> Yotascale is an anomaly detection model that uses statistical methods to detect pattern based anomalies with a hierarchy of tags. The model was trained for financial data of AWS and Azure cost files. It also caters to the edge cases like retagging of names. The end goal is to allow the sales team a new stable environment where they could showcase new/custom features. The code is on PySpark and the databases used are ClickHouse and PostgreSQL. Project orchestration is on Kubeflow. I was involved in orchestrating a scalable machine learning pipeline for Yotascale’s anomaly detection module using Kubeflow that used Apache Spark and various other AWS cloud services.
